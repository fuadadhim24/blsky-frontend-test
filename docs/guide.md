## Front-end
Left and right chat window/box. Left sends message to right, vice versa. When one sends message, the other  window flashes. Keep all messages so even when we close the tab and reopen it, old messages are there. Use nodejs and nextjs with only necessary libraries. Use a websocket implementation.
